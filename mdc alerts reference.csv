(Preview) Suspicious population-level spike in API traffic to an API endpoint,A suspicious spike in API traffic was detected at one of the API endpoints. The detection system used historical traffic patterns to establish a baseline for routine API traffic volume between all IPs and the endpoint  with the baseline being specific to API traffic for each status code (such as 200 Success). The detection system flagged an unusual deviation from this baseline leading to the detection of suspicious activity.,Impact,Medium,Alerts for Defender for APIs,(API_PopulationSpikeInAPITraffic)
(Preview) Suspicious spike in API traffic from a single IP address to an API endpoint,A suspicious spike in API traffic was detected from a client IP to the API endpoint.

Suspicious external operation to an Azure storage account with overly permissive SAS token (Preview),The alert indicates that someone with an external (public) IP address accessed the storage account using an overly permissive SAS token with a long expiration date. The access is considered suspicious because operations invoked outside your network (not from private IP addresses) with this SAS token are typically used for a specific set of Read/Write/Delete operations  but other operations occurred  which makes this access suspicious.,Exfiltration / Resource Development / Impact,Medium,Alerts for Azure Storage,Storage.Blob_AccountSas.UnusualOperationFromExternalIp
Unusual SAS token was used to access an Azure storage account from a public IP address (Preview),The alert indicates that someone with an external (public) IP address has accessed the storage account using an account SAS token.
